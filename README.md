This is a NextJS app made for the Leonardo coding assessment.

## About

THis project requires the user to set a username and job title before retrieving a paginated list of search results from a public graphql API

To do this the following libraries have been used

- ChakraUi
- Apollo
- Formik
- Nextjs

As well as the standard react, emotion and graphql libraries required to use the above.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
